### 24. Interactive MERN SPA Project

## Description 

We all love animals, an consider them as friends and family, yet finding the perfect animal Fur you can be quite a challenge. Making an informed choice based on both you and your potential fur-ever pet’s needs is essential. Some animals are high maintenance, some relaxed, some good with kids and some love swimming! Although there is not one perfect pet Fur everyone, there are many reasons why you should consider adopting.

 We’re here to change that, by helping users to search for pets so you can see who’s ready to be a part of your Fur-Ever Family, and to help these animals find a Fur-Ever Home.
